started my first month by adding new models and inference engines(TensorRT + Llama.cpp) to [Inference Arena](https://dria.co/inference-arena)

then i worked on MCP integration to enable [DNET](https://dria.co/dnet)(distribute mlx models across multiple macs) exposure for AI agent interactions and also built schema constrained generation on top of DNET using outlines library

*Currently working on function/tool calling and execution*
